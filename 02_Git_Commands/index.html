    <h1>Git - Version Control System</h1>
    <p>
        Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to
        very large projects with speed and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like
        Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and
        multiple workflows.
