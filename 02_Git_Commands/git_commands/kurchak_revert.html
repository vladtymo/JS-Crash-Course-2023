			<h2>Name</h2>

			<p>git-revert - Revert some existing commits</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Synopsis</h2>
			<code><pre>
<b>git revert</b> [--[no-]edit] [-n] [-m &lt;parent-number&gt;] [-s] [-S[&lt;keyid&gt;]]
&lt;commit&gt;…​
<b>git revert</b> (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit)
	</pre></code>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record
				some new commits that record them. This requires your working treee to be clean(no modifications from
				the HEAD commit).
			</p>
			<p>
				Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits
				(often only a faulty one). If you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working directory,
				you should see git-reset[1], particularly the <code>--hard</code> option. If you want to extract specific
				files
				as they were
				in
				another commit, you should see git-restore[1], specifically the <code>--source</code> option. Take care with
				these alternatives as both will discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Options</h2>
			<code>&lt;commit&gt;...</code>
			<p>
				Commits to revert. For a more complete list of ways to spell commit names, see gitrevisions[7]. Sets of
				commits
				can also be given but no traversal is done by default, see git-rev-list[1] and its <code>--no-walk</code>
				option.
			</p>
			<code>-e</code>
			<code>--edit</code>
			<p>
				With this option, <code>git revert</code> will let you edit the commit message prior to committing the
				revert.
				This is the
				default if you run the command from a terminal.
			</p>
			<code>-m parent-number </code>
			<code>--mainline parent-number </code>
			<p>
				Usually you cannot revert a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be considered the
				mainline. This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows revert to
				reverse the change relative to the specified parent.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reverting a merge commit declares that you will never want the tree changes brought in by the merge. As a
				result, later merges will only bring in tree changes introduced by commits that are not ancestors of the
				previously reverted merge. This may or may not be what you want.
			</p>
			<code>--no-edit </code>
			<p>With this option, <code>git revert</code> will not start the commit message editor.</p>
			<code>--cleanup=&lt;mode&gt; </code>
			<p>
				This option determines how the commit message will be cleaned up before being passed on to the commit
				machinery. See git-commit[1] for more details.
				In particular, if the <code>&lt;mode&gt;</code> is given a value of <code>scissors</code>, scissors will be
				appended to <code>MERGE_MSG</code> before being passed on in the case of a conflict.
			</p>
			<code>-n</code>
			<code>--no-commit</code>
			<p>
				Usually the command automatically creates some commits with commit log messages stating which commits were
				reverted. This flag applies the changes necessary to revert the named commits to your working tree and the
				index, but does not make the commits. In addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to
				match
				the HEAD commit. The revert is done against the beginning state of your index.
			</p>
			<p>This is useful when reverting more than one commits' effect to your index in a row.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Sequencer subcommands</h2>
			<code>--continue </code>
			<p>Continue the operation in progress using the information in <code>.git/sequencer</code>. Can be used to
				continue after
				resolving conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.</p>

			<code>--skip </code>
			<p>Skip the current commit and continue with the rest of the sequence.</p>

			<code>--quit </code>
			<p>Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used to clear the sequencer state after a failed
				cherry-pick or revert.</p>

			<code>--abort </code>
			<p>Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence state.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<code>git revert HEAD~3</code>
			<p>Revert the changes specified by the fourth last commit in HEAD and create a new commit with the reverted
				changes.</p>
			<code>git revert -n master~5..master~2</code>
			<p>
				Revert the changes done by commits from the fifth last commit in master (included) to the third last commit
				in
				master (included), but do not create any commit with the reverted changes. The revert only modifies the
				working
				tree and the index.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>Configuration</h2>
			<p>Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the git-config[1] documentation. The
				content is the same as what’s found there:</p>
			<code>revert.reference</code>
			<p>Settings this variable to true makes <code>git revert</code> behave as if the
				<code>--reference</code> option is given.
