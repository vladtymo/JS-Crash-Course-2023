        <div class="w-75">
            <p>This page is an examination of the git checkout command. It will cover usage examples and edge cases. In
                Git terms, a "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git
                checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches. In addition to the
                definition of "checkout" the phrase "checking out" is commonly used to imply the act of executing the
                git checkout command. In the
                <a class="link-site" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes">Undoing Changes</a>
                topic, we saw how git checkout can be used to view old commits. The focus for the majority of this
                document will be checkout operations on branches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Checking out branches is similar to checking out old commits and files in that the working directory is
                updated to match the selected branch/revision; however, new changes are saved in the project
                history—that is, it’s not a read-only operation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="title">New Branches</h3>
        <div class="w-75">
            <p>Git checkout works hand-in-hand with git branch. The git branch command can be used to create a new
                branch. When you want to start a new feature, you create a new branch off main using git branch
                new_branch. Once created you can then use git checkout new_branch to switch to that branch.
                Additionally, The git checkout command accepts a -b argument that acts as a convenience method which
                will create the new branch and immediately switch to it. You can work on multiple features in a single
                repository by switching between them with git checkout.
            </p>
            <p class="console">git checkout -b ＜new-branch＞</p>
            <p>
                The above example simultaneously creates and checks out ＜new-branch＞. The -b option is a convenience
                flag
                that tells Git to run git branch before running git checkout ＜new-branch＞.
            </p>
            <p class="console">git checkout -b ＜new-branch＞ ＜existing-branch＞</p>
            <p>
                By default git checkout -b will base the new-branch off the current HEAD. An optional additional branch
                parameter can be passed to git checkout. In the above example, ＜existing-branch＞ is passed which then
                bases new-branch off of existing-branch instead of the current HEAD.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="title">Switching Branches</h3>
        <div class="w-75">
            <p>
                Switching branches is a straightforward operation. Executing the following will point HEAD to the tip of
                ＜branchname＞.
            </p>
            <p class="console">git checkout ＜branchname＞</p>
            <p>
                Git tracks a history of checkout operations in the reflog. You can execute git reflog to view the
                history.
            </p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="w-75">
            This page focused on usage of the git checkout command when changing branches. In summation, git checkout,
            when
            used on branches, alters the target of the HEAD ref. It can be used to create branches, switch branches, and
            checkout remote branches. The git checkout command is an essential tool for standard Git operation. It is a
            counterpart to git merge. The git checkout and git merge commands are critical tools to enabling git
            workflows.
