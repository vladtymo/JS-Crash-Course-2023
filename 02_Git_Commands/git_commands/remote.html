    <h1>Git Commands-Remote</h1>
    <p>
            The SVN system uses a single, centralized repository that serves as a communication hub for developers.
        Collaboration is carried out by transferring changesets between developers' working copies and the central repository. 
        However, Git's distributed collaboration model assumes that each developer maintains their own copy of the repository, with their own local history and branch structure. 
        Typically, users do not share individual sets of changes, but a series of commits. 
        Instead of committing a single set of changes from a working copy to a central repository, Git allows entire branches to be transferred between repositories.

        The command git remoteis part of the system responsible for synchronizing changes. 
        Entries registered with the command git remoteare used in conjunction with the git fetch, git pushand commands git pull. 
        All of these commands are responsible for their part of the synchronization work. More details can be found by clicking on the relevant links.

    <h2>About git remote command </h2>

    <p>
        The command <code>git remote</code> allows you to create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. 
        Remote connections are more like bookmarks than direct links to other repositories. 
        They serve as friendly names that can be used to refer to a not-so-friendly URL, rather than providing real-time access to another repository.
