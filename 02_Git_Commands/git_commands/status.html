    <h1>About Git Status Command</h1>

    <h2>What Does git status Do?</h2>

    <p>When in doubt, run git status. This is always a good idea. The git status command only outputs information, it won't modify commits or changes in your local repository.</p>
    <p>A useful feature of git status is that it will provide helpful information depending on your current situation. In general, you can count on it to tell you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Where HEAD is pointing, whether that is a branch or a commit (this is where you are "checked out" to)</li>
        <li>If you have any changed files in your current directory that have not yet been committed</li>
        <li>If changed files are staged or not</li>
        <li>If your current local branch is linked to a remote branch, then git status will tell you if your local branch is behind or ahead by any commits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During merge conflicts, git status will also tell you exactly which files are the source of the conflict.</p>
