    <h1>About Git Pull Command</h1>
    
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>The git pull command is used to fetch the latest changes 
        from a remote repository and merge them into the local branch. 
        It is a combination of two Git commands: git fetch and git merge.
        When you run git pull, Git first fetches the latest changes from the
        remote repository and updates the local tracking branch. Then, it automatically 
        merges the changes into the current local branch, if there are no conflicts.
        The git pull command is useful when working on a team or collaborating with others on a project.
         It helps you to keep your local repository up-to-date with the changes made by others in the remote repository.
        You can also use the git pull command with specific options to customize its behavior. For example, 
        you can use the --rebase option to perform a rebase instead of a merge, or the --no-commit option to pull changes
         without creating a new commit.
        It's important to note that git pull can potentially overwrite local changes that haven't been committed or stashed, 
        so it's recommended to commit or stash changes before running the command.</p>
