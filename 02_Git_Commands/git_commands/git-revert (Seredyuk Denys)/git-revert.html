                    <p class="text">Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record them. 
                        This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).</p>
                    <p class="text">Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one). 
                        If you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working directory, you should see git-reset, particularly the --hard option. 
                        If you want to extract specific files as they were in another commit, you should see git-restore, specifically the --source option. 
                        Take care with these alternatives as both will discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.</p>

                    <p class="text">Commits to revert. 
                        For a more complete list of ways to spell commit names, see gitrevisions. 
                        Sets of commits can also be given but no traversal is done by default, see git-rev-list and its --no-walk option.</p>
                
                    <p class="text">-e</p>
                    <p class="text">--edit</p>
                    <p class="text">With this option, git revert will let you edit the commit message prior to committing the revert. 
                        This is the default if you run the command from a terminal.</p>

                    <p class="text">-m parent-number</p>
                    <p class="text">--mainline parent-number</p>
                    <p class="text">Usually you cannot revert a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be considered the mainline. 
                        This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows revert to reverse the change relative to the specified parent.</p>
                    <p class="text">Reverting a merge commit declares that you will never want the tree changes brought in by the merge. 
                        As a result, later merges will only bring in tree changes introduced by commits that are not ancestors of the previously reverted merge. 
                        This may or may not be what you want.</p>

                    <p class="text">--no-edit</p>
                    <p class="text">With this option, git revert will not start the commit message editor.</p>

                    <p class="text">--cleanup=&LTmode&GT</p>
                    <p class="text">This option determines how the commit message will be cleaned up before being passed on to the commit machinery. 
                        See git-commit for more details. In particular, if the &LTmode&GT is given a value of <code>scissors</code>, scissors will be appended to <code>MERGE_MSG</code> before being passed on in the case of a conflict.</p>

                    <p class="text">-n</p>
                    <p class="text">--no-commit</p>
                    <p class="text">Usually the command automatically creates some commits with commit log messages stating which commits were reverted. 
                        This flag applies the changes necessary to revert the named commits to your working tree and the index, but does not make the commits. 
                        In addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD commit. 
                        The revert is done against the beginning state of your index.</p>

                    <p class="text">--no-gpg-sign</p>
                    <p class="text">etc.</p>

                    <p class="text">Continue the operation in progress using the information in <code>.git/sequencer</code>. 
                        Can be used to continue after resolving conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text">--skip</p>
                    <p class="text">Skip the current commit and continue with the rest of the sequence.</p>

                    <p class="text">Forget about the current operation in progress. 
                        Can be used to clear the sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or revert.</p>
